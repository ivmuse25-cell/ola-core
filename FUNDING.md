# Funding OLA Core

OLA Core is an independent, privacy-first authentication framework for Linux.

To reach our roadmap goals — including full biometric backend, encrypted
templates, TPM integration, and cross-desktop support — we depend on community
funding and sponsorships.

## How Funding Helps
- Development time (Rust, security, hardware integration)
- Security audits and code review
- Test hardware: webcams, IR modules, laptops
- Documentation, examples, SDKs
- Cross-distro packaging (deb, rpm, flatpak)
