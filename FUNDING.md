# Funding OLA

**OLA (Open Linux Authentication)** is a community-driven project building privacy-first biometric authentication for Linux. We believe authentication should be secure, open, and respect your freedom.

## Why Fund OLA?

Linux is the backbone of the internet, powering servers, cloud infrastructure, and millions of desktops—yet it lacks modern, open-source biometric authentication comparable to proprietary systems. OLA fills this gap with:

- **Privacy-first design** - Your biometric data never leaves your machine
- **Open source transparency** - Auditable security, no vendor lock-in
- **Modular architecture** - Face, fingerprint, FIDO2, and more
- **Production-grade security** - Built with Rust, hardened systemd, peer credentials

## Current Funding Needs

We're seeking funding to accelerate development of critical features:

**Sprint 2 Goals ($15,000):**
- Face authentication backend (OpenCV + ONNX)
- PAM module for system-wide integration
- Fingerprint support (libfprint)
- Security audit by third-party firm

**Long-term Vision ($50,000):**
- Enterprise features (TPM, audit logging, remote auth)
- Multi-platform support (Wayland, X11 optimizations)
- Comprehensive test coverage and CI/CD
- Community outreach and onboarding

See our detailed [**Funding Roadmap**](docs/FUNDING_ROADMAP.md) for budget breakdown and timeline.
