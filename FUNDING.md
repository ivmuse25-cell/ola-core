# Funding OLA Core

OLA Core is an independent, privacy-first authentication framework for Linux.

## Why OLA Matters Now

As AI agents become part of our daily workflows, **human oversight of autonomous systems is critical**. OLA addresses a fundamental security gap:

**AI agents need strict authentication.**

- AI agents executing commands on your behalf
- Autonomous systems accessing sensitive data
- Agent-to-agent authentication in multi-agent environments
- Human-in-the-loop verification for high-risk agent actions

**OLA provides:**
- **Presence verification** via IR cameras (proof-of-human)
- **Biometric gating** for agent authorization (fingerprint, face)
- **Device authentication** to ensure agents run on trusted hardware
- **Multi-factor requirements** before agents can act autonomously

AI agents are not mature. Until they are, **humans must authenticate the agents, their systems, and their actions** using verifiable biometrics. OLA makes this possible on Linux.

## Roadmap Goals

To reach our vision — including full biometric backend, encrypted templates, TPM integration, and cross-desktop support — we depend on community funding and sponsorships.

### How Funding Helps
- Development time (Rust, security, hardware integration)
- Security audits and code review
- Test hardware: webcams, IR modules, fingerprint readers
- Documentation, examples, SDKs
- Cross-distro packaging (deb, rpm, flatpak)
- **AI agent authentication research and reference implementations**
